8/5/2025 14:11:41	nirushamunikar26@gmail.com	Nirusha Munikar	Speaker/Host Support	I am available on Mondays and Tuesdays from 4:00 PM to 10:00 PM. Additionally, I can offer flexible hours on Saturdays if needed. I'm also open to adjusting my schedule to support specific team or client requirements as they arise.	"I’ve attended various events and participated in hackathon, and I’m always inspired by how confidently speakers present and engage with large audiences. I aspire to become a confident speaker someday and share my knowledge with the community, just like the inspiring individuals I've seen on these platforms. However, I’ve not yet had the opportunity or confidence to take that step.

This is why I’ve chosen the Host/Speaker Support role to work closely with speakers and hosts, observe their preparation and delivery, and learn from their communication style, presence and audience interaction. Volunteering in this role will allow me to grow both personally and professionally while contributing meaningfully to the community.

I’m excited about the chance to be part of a vibrant learning environment and support the people who inspire others."
